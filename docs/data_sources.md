# Data Sources

Location classification scripts and the reformatting of Long Term Monitoring Program data
both have different requirements but neither is required to execute the other. The source of
the data required is described below.

## Common Data Requirements

The only data requirements for all scripts is the reefmod engine data package version 1.0.28
available on the RRAP M&DS Data Store.

## Location Classification

MPA and ACA refer to the Marine Park Authority and the Allen Coral Atlas respectively.

1. <sup>1</sup>mpa_geospatial_dir - MPA Output directory from the [GBR-reef-guidance-assessment](https://github.com/open-AIMS/GBR-reef-guidance-assessment)
2. <sup>1</sup>aca_geospatial_dir - ACA Output directory from the [GBR-reef-guidance-assessment](https://github.com/open-AIMS/GBR-reef-guidance-assessment)
3. <sup>2</sup>outer_shelf_gpkg   - Contained in the data directory.
4. <sup>2</sup>inner_shelf_gpgk   - Contained in the data directory.

<sup>1</sup>The MPA and ACA output directories are defined as a sub-directory of the documented [output
directory](https://github.com/open-AIMS/GBR-reef-guidance-assessment?tab=readme-ov-file#project-layout)

<sup>2</sup> The Geopackage files provided were created by Daniel Tan however any
geopackages that define shelf regions can be used.
## LTMP Reformatting

1. canonical_gpkg - Canonical Geopackage generated by [canonical-reefs](https://github.com/gbrrestoration/canonical-reefs)
2. ltmp_vid_photo - <sup>3</sup>AIMS LTMP fixed point [photogrammetry data](https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/5a8a4b00-4ade-11dc-8f56-00008a07204e)
3. ltmp_manta_tow - <sup>3</sup>AIMS LTMP [manta tow data](https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/5bb9a340-4ade-11dc-8f56-00008a07204e)

<sup>3</sup>AIMS LTMP is the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long Term Monitoring
Programming. The sampling methodology is described [here](https://www.aims.gov.au/research-topics/monitoring-and-discovery/monitoring-great-barrier-reef/reef-monitoring-sampling-methods).

## EcoRRAP

1. coral_observation_path - <sup>4</sup>EcoRRAP and Photogrammetry Coral observations found
   [here](https://github.com/open-AIMS/CoralDemography_EcoRRAP/blob/main/1_AnnaIPMs/1_data/EcoRRAP%20data%20for%20IPM_240630.csv)
2. coral_classification_path - <sup>4</sup>Mapping between C~Scape functional groups and
   photogrammetry/EcoRRAP species classification found [here](https://github.com/open-AIMS/CoralDemography_EcoRRAP/blob/main/1_AnnaIPMs/1_data/ecorrap%20to%20cscape%20species.csv)

<sup>4</sup>The repository containing the data is a private repository.
